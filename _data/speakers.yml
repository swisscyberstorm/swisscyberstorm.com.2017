How does an organization know whom to trust, when to share and how to transform the endless flood of security data into actionable information? Whether your intel sharing/gathering is peer to peer, public/private, commercial service or open source - there is a risk of realizing the quote from Aristotle: 'the more you know the more, the more you don’t know.’ Get the most out of your cybersecurity situational awareness efforts by learning from the successes and failures on the front lines of global critical infrastructure organizations."

programming general purpose computers for about six decades now, with spectacular results, mostly
good. As we contemplate the Internet of Things in light of our collective experience, there are some
disturbing conclusions to be drawn. Can we as a species safely place our economy and culture into a
global distributed network of computers, if those computers are programmed by humans using commodity
programming languages and tools?

  profile: "
  IoT is all the rage and we all have seen many presentations that left us chuckling at the abhorrent
security of these devices. Jos Wetzels takes that class of presentations one step further by leaving
the smart toothbrushes and iphone enabled dildos behind and examining IoT devices and industrial
control systems in environments where you would hope for higher standards: He looked at critical
infrastructures for electric, oil, gas and water utilities. He analyzed the operating systems used
in cars, nuclear power plants and military fighter jets. A lot of this work was carried out under
NDA conditions, but that does not prevent Jos from telling us about his lessons learnt. There is a
structural problem that he discovered, the search for a decent source of entropy. Getting truly
random numbers is hard and obtaining them in a controlled setting is a contradiction in itself. He
will touch on this and tell us how he thinks developers should improve IoT security.

  Tarah Wheeler is a thought leader on security and internet freedom. She is best known for her Women
in Tech book but at Cyber Storm, she will speak about the security and the digital transformation of
finance: Fiat currencies around the world are beginning to transition to a purely digital form and
the removal of the 500 Euro notes is only one of the more obvious signs. With a purely digital fiat
currency, black market monetary stockpiles would be exposed, the number of participants in the
banking system is meant to grow, and fiscal efficiency will be improved.  Money is now flowing
freely, with no capital controls, and the meta data surrounding financial transactions is more
valuable than the money itself - yet often poorly secured.  Meanwhile the blockchain or even crypto
currencies seem to be a disrupting technology and they will destroy many established business
models: It is very likely the Bretton Woods system as we know it will transform before our eyes in
the next few years.

 Tanya Janca's talk titled \"Pushing Left Like a Boss\" points at the Software Development Lifecycle
(SDLC) where the costs of bugs grow exponentially the longer you wait. Fix conceptual bugs
and they hurt, but wait until the product has been rolled out and conceptual errors have grown into
failures that threaten the existence of the product; to say the least. But how can you
push left? What are the best practices for your organisation to detect these failure early on and
to remain agile in your development. Can you build a DevOps pipeline without compromising on
security? Tanya Janca is a developer with almost 20 years of experience. She advocated 
safe coding practices for years, she accompanied the 42nd General Election in Canada as the IT

  profile: "
  Professor Daniela started out with research on performance in distributed video on demand systems.
She then shifted into the security domain and worked on malware detection in virtual machines,
kernel extensions and other hard technical security topics. But then, slowly, she started to bring
heuristics, behaviour models and psychology into the mix and her research turned to applied security
and human interactions with computers. A very typical development that we see over wide stretches of
the security industry. At our conference, this career scientist will speak about the
susceptibility of C-Level Management to spear phishing attacks. What angles do attackers use when
writing their bait messages and what are the keywords that will lead to a lethal click by the
receiver? What \"life domains\" need to be mentioned to draw the attention of the board member?
Daniela has originally researched this for elderly populations but is now focusing
on decision makers for our conference.

  Clément Guitton received his doctorate from the department of War Studies at the University College

In classical warfare, attribution is generally of an obvious nature thanks to the openness of the
attacks or physical evidence collected on the ground. In cyber campaigns however, attribution is one
of the hardest problems that is far some solved.  And it matters a lot as many Western countries are
revising the doctrines in case they come under attack and immediate retaliation with cyber counter
strike is now on the table. The discussion in Switzerland is turning in this direction as well
despite the 2nd edition of the National Cyber Strategy keeping its civil tone. Yet the NCS is
limited to non-crisis situations and the army is warming up to the topic of cyber warfare around
here. So we are happy to have a renown expert on the subject on stage at our conference.

  We all know, there is no business case for securing IoT hardware. There is no legislation and no
incentive to lock it down. But there is a lot of legal knowledge how a manufacturer can sneak out of
the responsibility via extensive EULAs. Our industry has been having great fun dissecting electronic
scales, smart toothbrushes and even IoT egg containers (here at SCS!). But the fun stops when
products with the same lousy level of security hit your corporate network. Stefan Lüders is the CISO
of CERN and he has first-hand experience with securing mission critical infrastructure when
separation and containment of insecure devices is no longer an option as strong stakeholders (CERN
physicists in Stefan's case) push for a wide introduction of hot sensors and control systems. So
what options do you have in such a situation? Stefan's talk will teach you how to live with these
devices. A separate talk by Jos Wetzels looks closer at the hardware itself.

  The famous quote “Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs
every time” stands at the beginning of Anthony Vance's talk. Yet, why are users behaving like this?
And why have 20 years of friends getting hacked, near-daily press coverage of security incidents and
tedious awareness programs failed to change this fundamental behaviour pattern?  Our speaker used
combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and traditional usability testing to examine users
while surfing the web and watching video clips. The results reveal a substantial effect of
neurobiology on user’s security behavior.  It is worth looking at his results in detail.  But
Anthony will also suggest practical ways to improve the security via a better design of user
interfaces.  Interfaces written with the awareness of the fact that neurobiological fundamentals are
hard to change.  His presentation will include various examples and suggestions in this direction.

for half of its existence and his background in Open Source Software is now coming at his service.
Despite initial resistance, Geneva made the complete transparency a prime characteristic of its
E-Voting solution.  And when it became clear that it's system was unfit to meet the high federal
standard to receive the certification for general use by 100% of the voters of a given canton,
Geneva decided to start over from scratch, to task the technical University of Berne to develop a
new voting protocol and to implement it in a completely open source process. At Swiss Cyber Storm,
Thomas Hofer will introduce us toCHVote and how Geneva intends to implement four independent control
systems to verify the votes. Meanwhile the former generation of CHVote is in use by multiple other
Swiss cantons."

  Raphael Reischuck has a deep interest with cryptographic primitives and the construction of secure

protocols the internet is built upon. If we are really honest, these protocols have proven to be
illfit for our security needs. The much needed performance boosts often came in the form of bolt-on
hacks instead of long-term visions. You could say that we have painted ourselves into a corner of a
room stacked with RFCs. Raphael Reischuck thinks it is time for something new. But unlike former
attempts to supersede TCP/IP and friends (attempts that are now long forgotten), SCION is designed
to allow a smooth transition. And after years of testing, piloting and revising the first
designs, the researchers of ETHZ are now coming out of cave to present us their new range of

potential of 26 different Swiss jurisdictions and a heavy standard document issued by the Federal
Cancellery. The cantons of Neuchatel and Fribourg have started to use the system actively in 2016
and the solution has been certified for use by 50% of the voters of a given canton. More cantons
decided to go with Swiss Post and the development is actively aiming for the 100% certification in
2018. Jordi's talk will present the Swiss Post system and their approach to the problems of voter
