Hall of Fame, then I think it is safe to say that this represents the
highest echelons of greatness that the IT industry has reserved for people 
like Vint Cerf, Tim Berners-Lee or Linus Thorvalds. I had been following Paul
from afar for many years. So when he was finally introduced into the hall in 2014 
I felt like it was the place where he belongs.<br>

Now let's take a look at Farsight Security. I think it has an interesting
business case, but he can explain that a lot better than I can.
So let's just think of the name: Farsight Security. Is not the ability to see 
far something we all aspire to? I always thought Paul had an excellent ability
to extrapolate current trends into the future and to anticipate 
the future as the signs developed on the wall. But when I met him in April
at an event of the Security Interest Group of Switzerland (SIGS), I realized
that he has an equal ability to describe past developments and how
the present came to be. The past can be chaotic and hard to understand,
but Paul brings order into the events and suddenly it all makes sense.<br>

In fact, I met Paul at a SIGS Q&A session where he responded to a wide
variety of questions in a very concise way. It was all
quotable material and I went home with many, many pages of handwritten
notes. See below for a link to a collection of Paul Vixie quotes.<br>

When the session was over, I thought I had nothing to lose and asked
Paul if he would be interested to speak at the Swiss Cyber Storm
conference and much to my surprise, he accepted! I was so excited!<br>

Paul has asked us to leave the topic of his keynote presentation
open for the time being. I think this makes a lot of sense and
we will define this together with him in time for the conference.
But whatever the topic is going to be, I can assure you that it
will be an excellent presentation.<br>

  profile: "At Swiss Cyber Storm 2016, Walter Belgers from TOOOL Netherlands
presented lock-picking as a metaphor of IT security hacking. This years
speaker Deviant Ollam is Walter's counterpart in TOOOL United States. He
has been called the godfather of Locksport and will show us how he combines lock
picking and the hacking of IT security systems to conquer physical
access control.  Add social engineering to give it an additional twist
and you get a very strong talk.<br>

<i>Deviant Ollam making himself comfortable</i><br>

Deviant Ollam is best known for his role at DefCon and Shmoocon, namely
in the Lockpick Village. But he is also a pioneering Android expert that
pushed the limits of security on the systems when security was literally
non-existing on these devices (not that much improved on Android in this
regard). Few will know, however, that he is also the uncrowned king of
hotel room cuisine and the Chef among the frequent flyers.<br>

If that is
still not enough to convince you that Devian Ollam is a gorgeous
addition to our schedule, then ask him about his experience with flying
with firearms or his recent flamethrower weekend. This man has war stories to last a week!

- speaker: Jos Wetzels 
  affiliation: "Researcher at the University of Twente"
  ptitle: "Industrial Control System / IoT Security"
  profile: "The internet of things is all the rage and talks about the insecurity of smart
devices and tech assistants are a constant companion at tech conferences these days. But
it's also a bit boring in the sense that the whole audience knows IoT is
insecure and the presentations are often déjà-vus of stupid mistakes on
cheap devices.<br>

<img src='/img/2017/Jos_Wetzels.jpg'>

<i>Jos Wetzels, Security Researcher</i><br>

Things get different when you stop talking about toothbrushes and
toasters and you turn to devices and control systems where security really
matters in a direct way. Health is often quoted (think pacemakers
with a remote control) and of course SCADA systems in high security
environments.<br>

Our Swiss Cyber Storm Speaker Jos Wetzels has seen a lot of these devices. 
His research with Twente University has focused on the protection of
critical infrastructures such as electric, oil, gas and water utilities.
Furthermore, it involved analysis of the operating systems used in cars, nuclear
power plants and military fighter jets.<br>

A lot of this work has been carried out
under the seal of NDAs (sorry, no photo of Jos in a MIG cockpit). But some of the
vulnerabilities can be disclosed and nothing prevents him from talking about structural
problems he regularly encounters when working with industrial control systems
and IoT devices. One such structural problem is the search for a decent source
of entropy. Getting truly random numbers is hard and obtaining them in a controlled
setting is a contradiction in itself. His recent CCC presentation exemplified this
in great detail.<br>

<br>
But Jos won't stop at pointing out shortcomings in existing systems. His
Swiss Cyber Storm presentation will also give advice on good IoT security. What you
can do to improve the situation in constrained environments and where developers
can make a difference.<br>

Jos has been part of the European Union's PREEMPTIVE project for the
protection of critical infrastructure. He has taught hands-on offensive
security classes at the Dutch Kerckhoffs Institute and he occasionally shows up
at Capture the Flag events. On top of that, I can confirm that Jos is good
company at a conference and I hope you get the chance to talk to him.<br>"
