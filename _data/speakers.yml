How does an organization know whom to trust, when to share and how to transform the endless flood of security data into actionable information? Whether your intel sharing/gathering is peer to peer, public/private, commercial service or open source - there is a risk of realizing the quote from Aristotle: 'the more you know the more, the more you don’t know.’ Get the most out of your cybersecurity situational awareness efforts by learning from the successes and failures on the front lines of global critical infrastructure organizations."

<i>Paul Vixie, Godfather of DNS</i><br>

We like to think of our industry as a meritocracy where the greatest minds
succeed. If you look over the list of people introduced into the Internet
Hall of Fame, then I think it is safe to say that this represents the
highest echelons of greatness that the IT industry has reserved for people 
like Vint Cerf, Tim Berners-Lee or Linus Thorvalds. I had been following Paul
from afar for many years. So when he was finally introduced into the hall in 2014 
I felt like it was the place where he belongs.<br>

Now let's take a look at Farsight Security. I think it has an interesting
business case, but he can explain that a lot better than I can.
So let's just think of the name: Farsight Security. Is not the ability to see 
far something we all aspire to? I always thought Paul had an excellent ability
to extrapolate current trends into the future and to anticipate 
the future as the signs developed on the wall. But when I met him in April
at an event of the Security Interest Group of Switzerland (SIGS), I realized
that he has an equal ability to describe past developments and how
the present came to be. The past can be chaotic and hard to understand,
but Paul brings order into the events and suddenly it all makes sense.<br>

<img src='/img/2017/Paul_Vixie_study.jpg'>

<i>Paul Vixie in his study</i><br>

In fact, I met Paul at a SIGS Q&A session where he responded to a wide
variety of questions in a very concise way. It was all
quotable material and I went home with many, many pages of handwritten
notes. See below for a link to a collection of Paul Vixie quotes.<br>

When the session was over, I thought I had nothing to lose and asked
Paul if he would be interested to speak at the Swiss Cyber Storm
conference and much to my surprise, he accepted! I was so excited!<br>

Paul has asked us to leave the topic of his keynote presentation
open for the time being. I think this makes a lot of sense and
we will define this together with him in time for the conference.
But whatever the topic is going to be, I can assure you that it
will be an excellent presentation.<br>

  profile: "
  The internet of things is all the rage and talks about the insecurity of smart
devices and tech assistants are a constant companion at tech conferences these days. But
it's also a bit boring in the sense that the whole audience knows IoT is
insecure and the presentations are often déjà-vus of stupid mistakes on
cheap devices.<br>

<img src='/img/2017/Jos_Wetzels.jpg'>

<i>Jos Wetzels, Security Researcher</i><br>

Things get different when you stop talking about toothbrushes and
toasters and you turn to devices and control systems where security really
matters in a direct way. Health is often quoted (think pacemakers
with a remote control) and of course SCADA systems in high security
environments.<br>

Our Swiss Cyber Storm Speaker Jos Wetzels has seen a lot of these devices. 
His research with Twente University has focused on the protection of
critical infrastructures such as electric, oil, gas and water utilities.
Furthermore, it involved analysis of the operating systems used in cars, nuclear
power plants and military fighter jets.<br>

A lot of this work has been carried out
under the seal of NDAs (sorry, no photo of Jos in a MIG cockpit). But some of the
vulnerabilities can be disclosed and nothing prevents him from talking about structural
problems he regularly encounters when working with industrial control systems
and IoT devices. One such structural problem is the search for a decent source
of entropy. Getting truly random numbers is hard and obtaining them in a controlled
setting is a contradiction in itself. His recent CCC presentation exemplified this
in great detail.<br>

<img src='/img/2017/Jos_Wetzels_CCC.png'>

But Jos won't stop at pointing out shortcomings in existing systems. His
Swiss Cyber Storm presentation will also give advice on good IoT security. What you
can do to improve the situation in constrained environments and where developers
can make a difference.<br>

Jos has been part of the European Union's PREEMPTIVE project for the
protection of critical infrastructure. He has taught hands-on offensive
security classes at the Dutch Kerckhoffs Institute and he occasionally shows up
at Capture the Flag events. On top of that, I can confirm that Jos is good
company at a conference and I hope you get the chance to talk to him.<br>

  Tarah Wheeler can be really vocal when it comes to gender equality, workplace
diversity and American politics in general. She is a thought leader and we
could fill a conference with Tarah explaining her view on all these topics. But
then you could also read her book about Women in Tech or ask her directly. At
Swiss Cyber Storm she will speak as security expert and share her insights into
the security challenges that Fintech poses to companies.

Tarah radiates energy with every fiber and I see a real chance of her
stunning everybody in the room. Will a restrained Swiss audience cope
with her charisma? But then we know that security is not for the faint
of heart and there are experiences that will only make you stronger. So
let's try this out.

<img src='/img/2017/Tarah_Wheeler.jpg'>

<i>Tarah Wheeler, Author and Cybersecurity Czar (photo by Lou Daprile)</i><br>

Fiat currencies around the world are beginning to transition to a
purely digital form. The Swiss National Bank seems to resist the trend
and decided to issue another 1000 CHF bill. Meanwhile the European
counterpart removed the 500 Euro notes from the market and India is
doing the same with the big rupee notes. With a purely digital fiat
currency, governments expect to expose black market monetary
stockpiles, increase the number of participants in the banking system,
and improve fiscal efficiency. But there is also a juggernaut preparing
to assault financial institutions: Crypto currencies. Money is flowing
freely, with no capital controls, and the metadata surrounding
financial transactions is more valuable than the money itself - yet
often poorly secured. It does not really matter if Bitcoin is a fad or
if Hyper ledger can live up to its promise: Blockchains are a disrupting
technology and they will destroy established business models: It is
very likely the Bretton Woods system as we know it will transform
before our eyes in the next few years.

<img src='/img/2017/Tarah_Wheeler_flamethrower.jpg'>

<i>You generally do not want to stand in the way of Tarah</i><br>

This all poses a huge security risk as the new Fintech businesses can no
longer be secured in the way a traditional bank was. Switzerland
is competing with London to be the Blockchain center of Europe and
the canton of Zug is being dubbed Crypto Valley. Yet how do all these
startups solve their inherent security problems?

In 2016, Mark Barwinski talked about his research into a state
sponsored spying operation at Swiss Cyber Storm. That operation,
meanwhile called Operation Cloud Hopper, is still not fully discovered,
but its basic characteristics a very clear: It is a state sponsored
attack on managed service companies and using their administration
machines to move laterally from one high profile customer to the next.

The digitalization and outsourcing of digital processes in the
financial world transforms the IT companies handling these assets and
processes into new forms of banks themselves. Not because of the
business they do, but because of the information they handle. If these
companies want to protect the assets in their custody they will need to
adopt to this transformation and embrace new security practices and
architectures.

  Imagine me attending the OWASP Application Security Europe conference
two weeks ago; the Swiss Cyber Storm program was almost full, but I
really wanted to have another addition to the management track. Security
DevOps sounded ideal and AppSecEU was running a two day track with
SecDevOps and DevSecOps. Although I can not really tell the two apart, I am
quite sure that I did not hear a DevOpsSec talk. So there I was hearing talk
after talk and getting more and more depressed. It is hard to select
talks from a huge pile of submissions and assembling four tracks over
two days must be harder still. But truth be told, the talks did not
convince me. They all resembled each other (DevSecOps? SecDevOps?) and I
got the idea they were all somewhat inconsistent at the same time.

  When we think of Bulletproof Hosting, we usually think of shady firms
in the style of the Russian Business Network that dodge all inquiries and
take-down notices from governments and potentially operating in corrupt
legislations where such behaviour is accepted. Nowadays, this
traditional centralized Bulletproof Hosting no longer works, although it
did not disappear. 
It has in fact morphed into a more modern flexible and elusive style
where hosters diversify their footprints across various spaces and
jurisdictions 
and act as dynamic business partners for criminals that want to host
illegal contents online. Copyright infringement? Not all country
prosecute it. Illegal Porn? Better know the jurisdiction. Stolen
data? We have servers in locations were your government won't be able

<i>Dhia Mahjoub, Head of Security Research at Cisco Umbrella</i>

As Head of Security Research at Cisco Umbrella (formerly OpenDNS), 
Dr. Dhia Mahjoub has excellent insight into the various moves of 
these shady web citizens. The key is of course making good use of the 
data and it takes a data scientist like Dhia to discover usage 
patterns in Autonomous Systems (AS) that allow to predict which 
IP space or domain names will be used for cybercrime before 
it actually happens.

Dhia Mahjoub leads the core research team focused on large scale threat
detection, threat intelligence and advises on Research and Development
strategy. Dhia has a background in networks and security and holds a 
PhD in graph algorithms applied on Wireless Sensor Networks problems.

Graphics and visualisation is in fact a key to his work. Dhia enjoys drawing
in his free time and is a frequent visitor to art museums during his frequent
travels. A vivid reader, he is interested in history and exploring new cities.
Dhia told me that he sees his research as a fusion of science, engineering
and art. It's the combination of these disciplines that help to solve
existing and novel problems in a creative and unconventional ways.
This is mirrored in his research and development team at Cisco Umbrella and
reminded me - once more - that IT security is opening up to new ideas.

he is a very skilled speaker. Looking up his bio underlined that impression
and revealed dozens of presentations at the biggest security conferences
all over the world: Black Hat, DefCon, RSA, ShmooCon, InfoSec Europe, BotConf,
etc. But then he continued and explained to me how he thinks that 
there is a bullet proof hoster operating from Switzerland and I was sold:
Here is a perfect Swiss Cyber Storm speaker! Even more so as Dhia
shares my belief that conferences are an inspiring place to learn
about the experiences of peers of various backgrounds.

  ptitle: "Susceptibility of C-Level Management to Spear Phishing"
  profile: "
  There is a shift in the world of IT security. Back in the 1990ties,
people thought security was a purely technical if not mathematical
problem. In one of his more famous quotes, Bruce Schneier stated 
that having written 'Applied Cryptography' he really thought,
that security was solved since he had just told the world how to
apply encryption.

As it turns out, people started to apply encryption but the overall
security did not improve and Bruce Schneier realized there were
more topics to cover and more books to write if he wanted to make
the world a safer place.

So, the technical field of IT security has opened itself to new
influences and new ideas. I see this development where ever
I look. But it struck me again, when I looked over the work of 
Professor Daniela Oliveira from the University of Florida.

<img src='/img/2017/Daniela_Oliveira.jpeg'>

<i>Daniela Oliveira, Professor at the University of Florida</i><br>

Daniela started out with research on performance in distributed
video on demand systems. She then shifted into the security domain
and worked on malware detection in virtual machines, kernel
extensions and other hard technical security topics.

That was a period when <a href='http://www.daniela.ece.ufl.edu/Knuth.jpg'>Donald Knuth came to join her class</a>
 and participate in a discussion on buffer overflows.
Daniela received an impressive collection of grants and awards that could
fill a blog post on its own.

But then, slowly, she started to bring heuristics, behaviour
models and psychology into the mix and her research turned to
applied security and human interactions with computers.

I had the pleasure to attend a presentation she gave about
her research. The talk centered around the susceptibility of 
older adults to spear-phishing emails. Daniela Oliveira was able
to show	that elderly populations are more likely to fall for certain
types of phishing emails, especially when they hit the right tune 
and align with the life domains of the victims. 

<img src='/img/2017/Daniela_Oliveira_students.jpeg'>

<i>Daniela Oliveira with some of her students</i><br>

We entered a conversation and I asked if she thought her research
would also apply to the susceptibility of C-level management to
spear-phishing mails as this would help to explain some of the
biggest financial frauds that happened in recent years in
Switzerland and abroad.

Daniela confirmed that impression and we are now talking about
the details of her presentation for our Swiss Cyber Storm
conference.

Daniela Oliveira is a professor at the Florida Institute for Cyber
Security (FICS). She has a family and owns a dog. She tries to shield
her Brazilian mother from falling for online scams and directs a
diversity program at the University of Florida. Professor Daniela Oliveira
is a skyrocketing career scientist and we are very happy to welcome
here in Lucerne.

  ptitle: "Attribution"
  profile: "
  There have been a few statements by Swiss politicians lately, trying to funnel
<a href='https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20173507'>more</a> 
<a href='https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20173199'>money</a> 
into the army to grow real cyber units with extensive attack capabilities.
Initiatives as this have been around for a while and usually I do not bother,
but the statements are growing more systematic in recent weeks. On top of it,
they coincidence with the ongoing definition of the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of the National
Cyber Strategy ('Nationale Strategie zum Schutz der Schweiz vor Cyber-Risiken')
and this makes the discussion a bit unsettling.

There is a case though. The NCS aims to define a policy for the
non-military domain and the non-crisis situations. So what is the role
of the military in all of this and what do you do when there is a
national crisis? I see room for discussion and the military seems overly
limited in its cyber defense resources and capabilities. But I doubt the
idea of so called 'offensive defense' in cyberspace and I certainly don't
buy into
the plan to train militia soldiers in four months to become national
'cyber warriors'. There are many cases that can be brought up against this
idea, and I am quite sure that attribution is often one of them.

Difficulties around investigating cyber attacks and, eventually,
identifying the instigators mean that the process is far from being
straight forward. Naturally, that means that we need to take into
consideration these different difficulties around attribution when looking
at retaliation. Combining a lack of reliable information with extensive
attack capabilities in the hands of under-trained amateurs would certainly
create a dangerous mix. It would be like putting soldiers with a rifle into
the fog and asking them to return the fire hoping to hit the attacker.

<img src='/img/2017/Clement_Guitton.jpg'>

<i>Cl&eacute;ment Guitton, Political Risk Analyst, SwissRe</i>

Attribution is notoriously tough. Maybe that's why you've read little
constructive
essays about the topic. Enters Dr. Cl&eacute;ment Guitton. Cl&eacute;ment Guitton
received his PhD from the Department of War Studies at King's College,
London, and worked as an analyst with the Department of Defense in
Switzerland.  In June, he joined SwissRe as a political risk analyst. A
few weeks before, he published 'Inside the Enemy's Computer. Identifying
Cyber Attackers', a book focusing on attribution that
received much acclaim.

The acclaim is entirely justified since Cl&eacute;ment Guitton really
sat down, put things into perspective and added the necessary and
unavoidable political dimension to
attribution. He provides a dependable framework to navigate
attribution cases and come to reliable conclusions.

<img src='/img/2017/Clement_Guitton_2.jpg'>

<i>Cl&eacute;ment Guitton's book about the attribution problem</i>

This means that Cl&eacute;ment Guitton's much needed input has brought light into a
dark area of our profession. How such conclusions translate for
Switzerland, a small country with little leverage, especially when compared
with the usual countries at the center of attention (think of the US,
Russia, China, Iran), makes up for an exciting discussion. 
For instance, Switzerland has made veiled allegations that it thinks Russia
stood behind several attacks on our country. But realistically, what can
the country do next? How can Switzerland deter or even retaliate? What
would a strategy look like? Such a strategy would probably have to
encompass non-cyber attack related measures, ranging from the diplomatic
(and ineffective) slap on the wrist to financial sanctions that
have a high potential to spiral out of control rapidly. Outside of
being not in our own interest.

  There is no business case for securing IoT hardware. There is no
legislation and no incentive to lock it down. But there is a lot of
legal knowledge how a manufacturer can sneak out of the
responsibility via extensive EULAs. Our industry has been having great
fun dissecting electronic scales, smart toothbrushes and even IoT egg
containers (here at SCS!). This was all a bit theoretical since nobody
sane in his mind would buy an electronic egg container and even if,
electronic egg containers are hardly mission critical.

But it was only a question of time before these gadgets would morph
into something useful and until they would hit our corporate networks.
This is about to happen right now and so it's time to look at this in
more detail.

When thinking about IoT for our conference, we wanted to have a speaker
who has daily exposure to these problems. We were looking for somebody
exploring the frontiers of securing IoT devices and we are very happy
we have found a skilled presenter at CERN in Switzerland who is facing
these questions every day: Dr. Stefan L&uuml;ders.

being only one of them. All these accelerators are supported by dozens
of different infrastructure systems, all operated and monitored with
the help of industrial control systems. But these ICS started to grow
into fully operated computers: Internet of Things devices. And while
there are some established procedures on how to secure ICS (segregation
into small compartments is probably best known), these approaches no
longer work. The devices are much more powerful and people want them to
be interconnected. So we need new approaches to operate them in a
secure manner.

  'Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time'. Generations of security officers have made jokes based on this popular saying and I have never heard anybody challenge its true core. Yet, why are users behaving like this? And why have 20 years of friends getting hacked, near-daily press coverage of security incidents and tedious awareness programs failed to change this fundamental behaviour pattern?

<img src='/img/2017/Anthony_Vance.jpg'>

<i>Prof. Anthony Vance, Brigham Young University</i>
<br>
Professor Anthony Vance wanted to sort this out. So he used combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and traditional usability testing to examine users while surfing the web and watching video clips. The results reveal a substantial effect of neurobiology on user's security behavior. It is worth looking at his results in detail: Security interfering with ongoing tasks (dual-task interference) has to fight for sufficient neural activation. And if the struggle puts it up against dancing pigs, the fight is over before it even started - or before it came to the attention of the user there was a decision to be made.

Anthony's results suggest practical ways to improve the security via a better design of user interfaces that is aware of neurobiological fundamentals that are hard to change. His presentation will include various examples and suggestions in this direction.

Did I mention he speaks German on top of it?

  title: CHVote - The E-Voting Offering of Geneva
  profile: "
  So there are two E-Voting offerings in Switzerland: one by the State of
Geneva
and one by Swiss Post. These two unlikely competitors are struggling to win
Swiss cantons over to their solution. Geneva has been doing E-Voting
since 2003 and five years ago, Thomas Hofer joined the team to serve as technical
administrator and operator of the voting process.

It was a difficult period for Geneva as their in-house developed
E-Voting system was under close scrutiny by researchers. They  scored a
success in court that gave them access to the source code of the Geneva
E-Voting system. As a result of that struggle, Geneva changed its
strategy and started to embrace the idea of open sourcing its E-Voting
software. With Thomas Hofer it found a very capable executor in its own
ranks who grew from operator to a partner of the University of
Applied Sciences Bern to develop a new voting protocol that satisfies
the higher security standard enforced by Swiss Federal Chancellery
since 2013 / 2014. That new protocol has been published in spring,
along side a proof of concept implementation
and Thomas is now working on the target implementation for CHVote. And
with CHVote, it's not only the source code that is open, the whole
development is moving to GitHub too.

<i>Thomas Hofer, Technical Expert, State of Geneva</i>
<br>
Prior to this engagement in Geneva he worked with the CERN security group and
graduated from EPFL with a master thesis on static source code analysis which
earned him the Kudelski Prize that recognizes master projects having
significantly contributed to the field of cryptography and information systems
security.  Thomas is an open source enthusiast to his bones. He is a co-leader
of the Geneva OWASP chapter and he has a knack for fixing annoying bugs in
software on weekends. Like so many other developers, his day job does not leave
him enough time to support third party software during office hours, but nobody
is keeping him from debugging these problems on weekends. Well nobody outside
of his children of course. This might hit a tune with some of you in the same
position.

For instance, he contributes now and then to a java wrapper for LibGMP,
a native library used to achieve much better performance than with bare
Java when computing complex arithmetic operations, such as the modular
exponentiations used in common cryptographic operations.

We are very pleased to have Thomas Hofer present the Geneva E-Voting
solution CHVote at our conference. In fact, we are more than pleased.
Everybody in this E-Voting business knows that I (Christian Folini
writing here) work on the security of the Swiss Post E-Voting solution.
Declining the invitation based on me colluding with the competition
would have been very natural.  Therefore, accepting my invitation to
Lucerne is first and foremost a display of good faith and I value that
very much. Geneva and Swiss Post have never appeared and presented at
the same conference and it is thanks to Thomas that this will be
happening in Lucerne."

  ptitle: "The Swiss Post E-Voting Solution"
  profile: "
  The plot was thickening for E-Voting making real inroads into Switzerland a few years ago. Swiss Post must have become aware that the physical transport of ballots was possibly going to be reduced in the long run.

Swiss Post is transporting the voting material to every Swiss voter and then - a specialty in Switzerland - most of the filled out ballots are transported by Swiss Post back into the ballot boxes (postal voting). And if you are aware that we are a direct democracy and there are at least four votes and elections for every voter every year, you realize this is a substantial business.

So Swiss Post decided to enter the E-Voting market itself and it made Swiss Mathematician Dr. Denis Morel the head of this venture. Swiss Post also decided not to develop its own E-Voting software (I presume Denis Morel had a say in this). Instead it would partner with an expert in the E-Voting field. Enter: SCYTL, a commercial E-Voting company from Barcelona.

SCYTL has been founded in 2001 as a spin-off of a research group for applied cryptography used in on-line voting from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, with the aim to apply the academic research into the real world. It has done elections literally all over the world, providing one of the first voting systems used in Switzerland (Neuchâtel) and developing the first online voting systems with verifiability in governmental elections like the end-to-end verifiability used in Norway in 2011. These security and auditability properties are achieved by means of application-level cryptographic protocols and E-Voting security. The man behind all this is SCYTL's Head of Research and Development, Jordi Puiggalí, one of the leading worldwide experts on E-Voting. Jordi has been with SCYTL since the beginning, when he left his job as technical director for PKI at the Autonomous University in Barcelona to help found this E-Voting startup.

SCYTL contributes to the partnership with it's E-Voting software and a
long experience. Swiss Post on the other hand runs the infrastructure, 
protects it from attacks (plus a strong Swiss brand that has the trust 
of Swiss voters like no other). In spring 2017, Swiss Post accomplished the 50% certification of the Swiss federal chancellery that allows its E-Voting offering to be used by 50% of the electorate (= voters) of a given canton. The next step is the 100% certification that comes with many additional requirements that need to be fulfilled.

But who would come to Lucerne to present this at Cyber Storm? I mean there are a lot of people involved at Swiss Post of course; namely at the infrastructure level. But there is nobody who has the expertise and detailed knowledge of Jordi Puiggalí when it comes to the intrinsics of the protocols involved with the electronic voting deployed by this partnership.

So Swiss Post decided Jordi Puiggalí from Barcelona would present its solution in Lucerne at our conference. And I am very pleased with that decision. I love talking infrastructure protection with the people at Swiss Post. But at the core of any E-Voting setup is the cryptographic protocol that protects the votes from manipulation while guaranteeing the anonymity of the voter. So we need somebody to explain exactly this core technology and Jordi is the perfect person to do this.
