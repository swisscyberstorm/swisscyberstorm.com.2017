Which players are involved in the darknet? How do they organise
themselves? How are they finalising the transactions and how
do they exchange money and goods? (Unless they do not trade goods,

He is the founder of EnergySec, and currently its President and CEO. This nonprofit information sharing organization began as a few colleagues meeting for lunch and has grown into a nationwide effort to promote sound security principles in the energy industry. <br>One of his strengths is the diversity of his professional experience. In Energy, he has held positions with a utility, a regulator, and a private consulting firm. He has also held key positions in the Insurance, Internet and Telecommunications sectors. Among other credentials he holds the CISA, CRISC and CISSP certifications. <br>Patrick is an active member of several critical infrastructure security working groups and a sought after speaker and industry expert on the subjects of critical infrastructure protection, process control system security, regulatory compliance, audit, and privacy."
  abstract: "Threat Intelligence Sharing is being called the Holy Grail of cybersecurity by many. It is also being called the Flavor of the Month by others. Does it really provide the promised value? How does an organization know whom to trust, when to share and how to transform the endless flood of security data into actionable information? Whether your intel sharing/gathering is peer to peer, public/private, commercial service or open source - there is a risk of realizing the quote from Aristotle: 'the more you know the more, the more you don’t know.’ Get the most out of your cybersecurity situational awareness efforts by learning from the successes and failures on the front lines of global critical infrastructure organizations."
