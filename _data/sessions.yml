  description: "Bug bounty programs are getting more and more traction. Some see them
as a cheap way to get a lot of pen-tests for free and some see them as
the creation of a global market for security testing. Mazin Ahmed will
take a close look at existing bug bounty programs and explain some of
the merits of the bounty hunting community sites. He will also take the
perspective of the Companies attempting to set up a bug bounty program
and highlight widespread misconceptions and why they are wrong. Spice
this up with demonstrations of bugs he discovered recently and stories
from the adventurous life of a whitehat hacker living in Khartoum,
Sudan."

  It is surprisingly simple to hack applications using a
conventional browser and a notepad. We show you that there is no need for
complicated tools or a server farm to confuse applications and to circumvent
input validation. And, of course, we also show you how to protect your
applications from these and other attacks.

  Beware, bIOTech is not necessarily Biotech. The talk will give an
intro into the Compass deliberately vulnerable plant watering (humidity)
sensor - bIOTech. A piece of IoT that makes use of the Expressif Systems’
ESP8266 module and connects to the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html'>hacking-lab.com</a> platform. An environment,
readily available to teach and experiment with information security aspects.
You will get a kick-start on how to setup the device and how to tamper with
its credential storage. Grab your own device right after the talk.

  subtype: presentation
  place: "Speaker's Corner"
  speakers: [MiroLjubicic]
  description: "
  Businesses are focused on reducing costs and providing greater
value while trying to be compliant, which is why they are focused on digital
transformation. However, cyber resilience must be an essential part of this
transformation process – not an afterthought. Upfront design and
architecture along with continual review and testing will save considerable
time and resources in recovering from a cyber attack. It is vitally
important that we, as a cyber community, collaborate and take action.
And if we don’t? The digital transformation that has increased global
knowledge and social awareness will be undermined and the trust in our
digital economy and the liberty it has provided us is at stake.
Miro Ljubicic will share some practical examples, how business benefits of
embedding cyber resilience into the digital transformation and why cyber
security must be seen as an essential part of providing real business value
and not by simply adding cost and slowing time to market."

  description: "In past couple of years the World has started moving towards Mobility. The applications and gadgets using those applications have seen to be growing exponentially. This has also brought endless possibilities of Security Breaches. <br>
This is the World of <b>Mobile Warfare</b>. We have seen recent cases where even LEA (Law Enforcement Agencies) is trying to break into your phone and monitor all your activities. Our smart-wearable store all our personal data like health data, which can be used to carry out a targeted Chemical attack (think about it).
On a bigger picture, what if Smart Weapons being used in a country’s defense are compromised? What is health related data of our soldiers is leaked? Smart gadgets are built for good purpose, but can it not be misused for massive destruction? <br>

  description: "In this lecture, Walter Belgers will look at security flaws in locks to
see how they came about. He shows us how similar mistakes are made in
software development and in the deployment of safety locks: In both
cases, we have to deal with design flaws, implementation errors, denial
of service attacks, zero days, brute force attacks, user errors and
more.  Walter will demonstrate these physical flaws live and we will see
some interesting differences in the way security is looked at in
hardware and in software: Lock designers and software engineers have a
lot to learn from each other."
