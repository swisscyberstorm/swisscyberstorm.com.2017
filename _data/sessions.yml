  subtype: presentation
  speakers: [ahmed]
  description: "Bug bounty programs are getting more and more traction. Some see them
as a cheap way to get a lot of pen-tests for free and some see them as
the creation of a global market for security testing. Mazin Ahmed will
take a close look at existing bug bounty programs and explain some of
the merits of the bounty hunting community sites. He will also take the
perspective of the Companies attempting to set up a bug bounty program
and highlight widespread misconceptions and why they are wrong. Spice
this up with demonstrations of bugs he discovered recently and stories
from the adventurous life of a whitehat hacker living in Khartoum,
Sudan."

  subtype: presentation
  description: "In past couple of years the World has started moving towards Mobility. The applications and gadgets using those applications have seen to be growing exponentially. This has also brought endless possibilities of Security Breaches. <br>
This is the World of <b>Mobile Warfare</b>. We have seen recent cases where even LEA (Law Enforcement Agencies) is trying to break into your phone and monitor all your activities. Our smart-wearable store all our personal data like health data, which can be used to carry out a targeted Chemical attack (think about it).
On a bigger picture, what if Smart Weapons being used in a country’s defense are compromised? What is health related data of our soldiers is leaked? Smart gadgets are built for good purpose, but can it not be misused for massive destruction? <br>
Hear me in detail only at Swiss Cyber Storm 2016 "

  description: "Military Information and Communication Systems are increasingly interconnected and use the similar when not the same components of civilian systems. Cyber-Incidents on military systems are thus technically very similar. Decision processes and impact of incidents are on the other side quite different. Examples of international trainings and exercises on the technical and operative level will be presented."

  speakers: [belgers]
  description: "In this lecture, Walter Belgers will look at security flaws in locks to
see how they came about. He shows us how similar mistakes are made in
software development and in the deployment of safety locks: In both
cases, we have to deal with design flaws, implementation errors, denial
of service attacks, zero days, brute force attacks, user errors and
more.  Walter will demonstrate these physical flaws live and we will see
some interesting differences in the way security is looked at in
hardware and in software: Lock designers and software engineers have a
lot to learn from each other."
