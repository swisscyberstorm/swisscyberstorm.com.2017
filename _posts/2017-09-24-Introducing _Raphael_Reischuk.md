The more we depend on the internet for our everyday lives, the more we realize
how many design flaws are built into its basic architecture. The net was built
for scale and resilience, but it was not built for security. The much needed performance
boosts often come in the form of bolt-on hacks instead of long-term visions.
You could say that we are painting ourselves into a corner of a room stacked
with RFCs.

Through the years, there have been many attempts to push a new basic design
for the internet. Some of them have lead to improvements in individual
protocols, others vanished without leaving many traces outside of specialized
technical journals.

In recent years, researchers of the Network Security Group at the
ETH in Zurich have pondered their own proposal: The SCION Project. The drafts
have been reworked, proof of concepts have been done and countless papers have
been peer-reviewed and published.

Lately, the activities intensified. Real-world deployments have started and
the team of the ETH Network Security Group started to share its ideas
outside of specialized circles. Banks, insurance companies and Internet providers
are now interested in getting acquainted with the new technology.

I met one of these team members in spring at a SIGS conference. We hit it off
immediately, but I was reluctant to add his presentation to the program for
Swiss Cyber Storm since I thought it too heavy on the network side.

More talks followed, a reorganisation of the schedule bringing more space and
here we are: I am very happy to announce Dr. Raphael Reischuk from the
SCION Project.

Raphael received his PhD from Saarland University for a privacy-related
dissertation: He created a protocol that allows an electricity
consumer to keep his or her exact consumption data private, to
communicate the amount of the electricity bill to the utility, and to
guarantee the utility that the communicated amounts are correct.
This confirmation is performed with the help of zero-knowledge proofs.

Publications as this are typical for Raphael's interests that lie with
cryptographic primitives and the construction of secure protocols based on
these building blocks. He must be quite good at this since
his PhD received a "summa cum laude" and that electricity consumption
article was awarded with the CNIL-Inria Award for Privacy Protection,
granted by the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty in France.

I hear Raphael is also an avid hiker who loves nature a lot. Maybe this
love for the Alps prevented him from accepting one of the various job offers
outside Switzerland so far. All the better for us.
