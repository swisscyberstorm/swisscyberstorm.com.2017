title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Tarah Wheeler

---

Tarah Wheeler can be really vocal when it comes to gender equality, workplace
diversity and American politics in general. She is a thought leader and we
could fill a conference with Tarah explaining her view on all these topics. But
then you could also read her book about Women in Tech or ask her directly. At
Swiss Cyber Storm she will speak as security expert and share her insights into
the security challenges that Fintech poses to companies.

Tarah radiates energy with every fiber and I see a real chance of her
stunning everybody in the room. Will a restrained Swiss audience cope
with her charisma? But then we know that security is not for the faint
of heart and there are experiences that will only make you stronger. So
let's try this out.

Fiat currencies around the world are beginning to transition to a
purely digital form. The Swiss National Bank seems to resist the trend
and decided to issue another 1000 CHF bill. Meanwhile the European
counterpart removed the 500 Euro notes from the market and India is
doing the same with the big rupee notes. With a purely digital fiat
currency, governments expect to expose black market monetary
stockpiles, increase the number of participants in the banking system,
and improve fiscal efficiency. But there is also a juggernaut preparing
to assault financial institutions: Cryptocurrencies. Money is flowing
freely, with no capital controls, and the metadata surrounding
financial transactions is more valuable than the money itself - yet
often poorly secured. It does not really matter if Bitcoin is a fad or
if Hyperledger can live up to its promise: Blockchains are a disrupting
technology and they will destroy established business models: It is
very likely the Bretton Woods system as we know it will transform
before our eyes in the next few years.

This all poses a huge security risk as the new Fintech businesses can no
longer be secured in the way a traditional bank was. Switzerland
is competing with London to be the Blockchain center of Europe and
the canton of Zug is being dubbed Crypto Valley. Yet how do all these
startups solve their inherent security problems?

In 2016, Mark Barwinski talked about his research into a state
sponsored spying operation at Swiss Cyberstorm. That operation,
meanwhile called Operation Cloud Hopper, is still not fully discovered,
but its basic characteristics a very clear: It is a state sponsored
attack on managed service companies and using their administration
machines to move laterally from one high profile customer to the next.

The digitalization and outsourcing of digital processes in the
financial world transforms the IT companies handling these assets and
processes into new forms of banks themselves. Not because of the
business they do, but because of the information they handle. If these
companies want to protect the assets in their custody they will need to
adopt to this transformation and embrace new security practices and
architectures.
