title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speakers Harald Reisinger and Aldo Frick

Last spring, I attended a presentation by the boss of a large
translation bureau.  Not what you expect at a meeting of security
experts, so I was not sure what I would learn. But the longer he took,
the more interested I got.  Here was somebody who was using security to
sell his service: He was not merely fulfilling requirements to pass
audits and be certified. No, this translator, who had grown into the
owner of a translation bureau operating worldwide with thousands of
translator, had realized that security is what could set him apart from
the competition. His corporate customers have an exceptionally high
demand for discretion and privacy and he has built all the processes in
his company around this desire. And while audits by potential customers
used to be a huge pain for him, they are now a brief discussion
where he hands over his prepared documentation.

Effectively, the security in this company is no longer an obstacle, but
a value proposition.  Security has set him miles ahead of the
competition that still fights for the lowest costs, while he is not
even talking about price with his customers but about the number of
service options that should fit into the package.


This complete presentation all came back when I started to talk to Harald
Reisinger, Managing Director of RadarServices and Aldo Frick, member of the
Executive Board of FL1 - Telecom Liechtenstein. They are presenting together at
our upcoming conference on October 18.  They have proposed the title 'Cyber
Security and Corporate Strategy - Transforming a Cyber Defense Center into a
Value Proposition' and I think this points at one of the core problems of our
industry; the big budget problem of the CISO: How can you justify the huge
costs of running a 7x24 SOC and all the other cost drivers associated with
security.  This only works when you can explain how these costs enable the
company to sell its services. Services that would be insecure and a lethal risk
for the future of the company (Equifax anyone?) otherwise.

Radar Services and FL1 - Telecom Liechtenstein are the gold sponsors for
Swiss Cyber Storm 2017. 

If you think about sponsoring for a moment, then you realize that it is
actually a funny thing. Every conference will need sponsors one way or
the other. Swiss Cyber Storm tickets are already quite expensive and
going without sponsors would easily double their price. But of course,
sponsors will only support your event if they get something in return.
And the gold standard for "something in return" is the right to speak
in front of the audience. However, the organizer would rather not have
any sales pitches in front of the audience or the quality of the
conference suffers one way or the other - and the program chair will
throw in the towel.

So Swiss Cyber Storm has a reputation to be really tough on sponsors in
the sense that only the gold sponsor is granted the right to speak
while the other sponsors get room to present themselves between the
talks and in the printed conference material.  And it's not like other
companies did not ask to be allowed to speak.  In fact, potential
sponsors pressured us to let them appear on the stage and when we
refused they stopped the negotiations. And even a private speaker
proposed to pay us 1'000 CHF if he was accepted into the official
program. Needless to say he did not make the cut.

Ideally, a sponsor and an event have aligned core values. For Swiss
Cyber Storm this is a security oriented mindset, a high level of
quality and a certain international flair. And I think Radar Services
and FL1 - Telecom Liechtenstein represent these values in an ideal way.
Telecom Liechtenstein is a new player, yet it accepts the responsibility 
to protect the assets of its customers and partners with strong
security companies like RadarServices. And RadarServices is able to
tailor its offerings to the
exact demands of its customers while maintaining a high level of
security; a perfect partnership.

That's why I am very happy to welcome Harald Reisinger and Aldo Frick
in the official program of our conference. [Register now](https://www.eventbee.com/v/scs2017)
