title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Daniela Oliveira

There is a shift in the world of IT security. Back in the 1990ties,
people thought security was a purely technical if not mathematical
problem. In one of his more famous quotes, Bruce Schneier stated 
that having written "Applied Cryptography" he really thought,
that security was solved since he had just told the world how to
apply encryption.

As it turns out, people started to apply encryption but the overall
security did not improve and Bruce Schneier realized there were
more topics to cover and more books to write if he wanted to make
the world a safer place.

So, the technical field of IT security has opened itself to new
influences and new ideas. I see this development where ever
I look. But it struck me again, when I looked over the work of 
Professor Daniela Oliveira from the University of Florida.

Daniela started out with research on performance in distributed
video on demand systems. She then shifted into the security domain
and worked on malware detection in virtual machines, kernel
extensions and other hard technical security topics.

That was a period when [Donald Knuth came to join her class](http://www.daniela.ece.ufl.edu/Knuth.jpg)
and participate in a discussion on buffer overflows.
Daniela received an impressive collection of grants and awards that could
fill a blog post on its own.

But then, slowly, she started to bring heuristics, behaviour
models and psychology into the mix and her research turned to
applied security and human interactions with computers.

I had the pleasure to attend a presentation she gave about
her research. The talk centered around the susceptibility of 
older adults to spear-phishing emails. Daniela Oliveira was able
to show	that elderly populations are more likely to fall for certain
types of phishing emails, especially when they hit the right tune 
and align with the life domains of the victims.

We entered a conversation and I asked if she thought her research
would also apply to the susceptibility of C-level management to
spear-phishing mails as this would help to explain some of the
biggest financial frauds that happened in recent years in
Switzerland and abroad.

Daniela confirmed that impression and we are now talking about
the details of her presentation for our Swiss Cyber Storm
conference.

Daniela Oliveira is a professor at the Florida Institute for Cyber
Security (FICS). She has a family and owns a dog. She tries to shield
her Brazilian mother from falling for online scams and directs a
diversity program at the University of Florida. Professor Daniela Oliveira
is a skyrocketing career scientist and we are very happy to welcome
here in Lucerne.
