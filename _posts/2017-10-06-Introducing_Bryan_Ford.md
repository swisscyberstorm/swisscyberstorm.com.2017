title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Bryan Ford

When I introduced the [E-Voting
Focus](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/2017/08/03/Announcing-E-Voting-Theme-Focus.html)
at Swiss Cyber Storm, I hoped we could help to ignite a public discussion on
this transformation of our democratic process. As I am writing this, I know
this public discussion has started and our role is now to add knowledge and
information to the discussion.

Since I wrote the announcement in August, we have [introduced Thomas
Hofer](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/2017/09/18/Introducing_Thomas_Hofer.html)
as speaker for the E-Voting Solution CHVote of the State of Geneva, we have
[introduced Jordi
Puiggalí](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/2017/09/26/Introducing_Jordi_Puiggali.html)
as the speaker for the Swiss Post E-Voting solution. Outside of our conference,
Adrienne Fichter has published her [book on the SmartPhone
democracy](http://www.nzz-libro.ch/adrienne-fichter-smartphone-demokratie-fakenews-facebook-bots-civictech.html)
that is looking at the various effects that are connected with moving the
political discussions online. In the parliament Franz Grüter (Swiss People's
Party), launched an initiative for a [four year moratorium](
http://www.inside-it.ch/articles/48821)
on E-Voting with the
exception of Swiss nationals abroad. He insists that E-Voting is insecure, so
only a small percentage should be allowed to use it. I can't help to think that
this initiative would make it seem as if a small percentage of insecure votes
don't matter much in Swiss public votes.

Afterwards, Marcel Dobler (Liberal Party) handed in an
initiative that calls for a [big national Capture the Flag competition](
https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/sicherheitschecks-bei-e-voting-hackt-uns-wenn-ihr-koennt)
with serious money in the pot to find out if
the existing solutions from Geneva and Swiss Post live
up to their promises. It is a wildly populist proposal in my eyes. But
from a hacker perspective, the idea has a certain
appeal. I mean we could take our [Swiss Cyber Storm team](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/challenges/overview/)
for the European Cyber Challenge competition, win
the E-Voting Capture the Flag and be done with all our
funding problems for the conference for a couple of
years...

But jokes aside, let's look back at our conference.
There is only one E-Voting speaker left and that is
going to be the person introducing the topic. As I
have made clear in my previous posts, E-Voting poses
singular problems that you won't find anywhere else.
The need for voter anonymity is one, the need for absolute
confidence in the votes cast and the results of a
vote is another one. You need a sound way to verify the votes and the
results after an election and this process needs to
withstand a lot of scrutiny. And lately with the
blockchain hype, everybody calls for blockchain
solutions for E-Voting so it would be nice if said
speaker would also cover that question.

Ah yes, and then it would be good if the speaker
would have a high renown and not be tied to one
of the existing offerings. As I have explained, there
is a certain level of competition between the two
offerings.

So it took us a while to come up with such a speaker.
But I am now very happy to be able to announce Prof.
Bryan Ford from the EPFL, formerly Yale and MIT, as our
speaker. Bryan Ford leads the Decentralized/Distributed 
Systems (DEDIS) lab in Lausanne where he works on
securing private and anonymous communication
technologies. Bryan Ford also presented to a group
of cantons lately when they met at the Federal
Chancellery in Berne and so I think he is the perfect
E-Voting keynote speaker.

So what you get at Swiss Cyber Storm is an overview
over E-Voting and general, how the two competitors 
stack up against each other and how they intend to
solve the core problems with E-Voting.

The conference is now less than two weeks away.
If you are interested in E-Voting or one of the
many other topics we will be discussing, you should
