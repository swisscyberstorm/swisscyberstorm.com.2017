title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Thomas Hofer

So there are two E-Voting offerings in Switzerland: one by the State of
Geneva
and one by Swiss Post. These two unlikely competitors are struggling to win
Swiss cantons over to their solution. Geneva has been doing E-Voting
since 2003 and five years ago, Thomas Hofer joined the team to serve as technical
administrator and operator of the voting process.

  It was a difficult period for Geneva as their in-house developed E-Voting
  system was under close scrutiny by researchers, who felt hindered in their
  analysis by the difficulty of obtaining access to the source code. Indeed,
  due to the conception that such systems were best kept as secret as
  possible, only people allowed to vote in the canton were allowed to access
  the source code, upon official request. Since then, Geneva changed its
  strategy and started to embrace the idea of open sourcing its E-Voting
  software.
 With Thomas Hofer it found a very capable executor in its own
ranks who grew from operator to a partner of the University of
Applied Sciences Bern to develop a new voting protocol that satisfies
the higher security standard enforced by Swiss Federal Chancellery
since 2013 / 2014. That new protocol has been published in spring,
along side a proof of concept implementation
and Thomas is now working on the target implementation for CHVote. And
with CHVote, it's not only the source code that is open, the whole
development is moving to GitHub too.

<i>Thomas Hofer, Technical Expert, State of Geneva</i>

Prior to this engagement in Geneva he worked with the CERN security group and
graduated from EPFL with a master thesis on static source code analysis which
earned him the Kudelski Prize that recognizes master projects having
significantly contributed to the field of cryptography and information systems
security.  Thomas is an open source enthusiast to his bones. He is a co-leader
of the Geneva OWASP chapter and he has a knack for fixing annoying bugs in
software on weekends. Like so many other developers, his day job does not leave
him enough time to support third party software during office hours, but nobody
is keeping him from debugging these problems on weekends. Well nobody outside
of his children of course. This might hit a tune with some of you in the same
position.

For instance, he contributes now and then to a java wrapper for LibGMP,
a native library used to achieve much better performance than with bare
Java when computing complex arithmetic operations, such as the modular
exponentiations used in common cryptographic operations.

<i>Thomas Hofer when he's not coding</i>

We are very pleased to have Thomas Hofer present the Geneva E-Voting
solution CHVote at our conference. In fact, we are more than pleased.
Everybody in this E-Voting business knows that I (Christian Folini
writing here) work on the security of the Swiss Post E-Voting solution.
Declining the invitation based on me colluding with the competition
would have been very natural.  Therefore, accepting my invitation to
Lucerne is first and foremost a display of good faith and I value that
very much. Geneva and Swiss Post have never appeared and presented at
the same conference and it is thanks to Thomas that this will be
happening in Lucerne.

[Join us and register](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/conference/)
for the Swiss Cyberstorm Conference on 18th October to hear how
the State of Geneva goes about developing a next generation E-Voting
system.
