We had a few impressive talks at Swiss Cyberstorm 2016. Troy Hunt surprised me
regarding his diligence with everything around account breaches.  John Matherly
/ Shodan and Marc Ruef with his Dark Net talk hit it home in a perfect way. I
was very happy that Nick Galbreath's talk resonated with so many people in the
room who had never heard his name before. And then of course Mazin Ahmed from
Al-Khartum: I mean putting a 19 year old Sudanese hacker on the program is
rather risquée. But yeah, he did a great job.  Herbert Bos gave us a glimpse on
a weakness that would later become known as Drammer. Gorgeous presentation.

I went home with a big smile on my face and when president Bernhard
Tellenbach asked me to take over the program chair position I was even
happier still. I have to admit I really like the challenge to find good speakers 
an to compose an interesting conference program.

Many conferences ask for submissions via a Call for Papers. That is a
very good method to get quality research to a conference. But truth be
told, it is also a lot of hard work to review all the submissions. And
given the amount of time and effort the submitters invested in their
proposals, you really need to do this in a proper way or it is very
unfair. But even with a superb CFP campaign, you end up with a dilemma:
A CFP selects the best exposés, while you ask for the best research and
you actually want the best presentations. That's three wildly different
things. And then there is of course the risk of ending up with a very
unbalanced program where the best papers were all submitted in the same
area of tech.  All this combined explains why we do it differently at
Swiss Cyberstorm: We do a curated program.

This means we pick the best speakers and the best presentations in order
to create an attractive program. Designing such a program also takes a
lot of time.  It involves talking to a lot of people and watching many
hours of youtube...

But we are on good tracks for 2017 and while I won't give away any names
just yet, here are a few areas that we will cover at this year's
conference:

We omitted the IoT hype last year, but we are going to address it this
time.  Well not the hype, but real software running on real devices.  We
have a very interesting speaker and I am currently looking for a second
one. Ideally an IoT security success story. If you know one, then please
get in touch.

A growing trend in IT security is to look for solutions outside
technology.  It would warrant a talk on its own, why this is the case. I
think we are beyond the point where we assume we can solve security
problems by educating users to use PGP. What I see is people with
non-technology backgrounds entering IT security and proposing new
solutions or new perspectives on well-known problems. We are going to
have one or two talks that fall into this category.

One topic that was never covered at Swiss Cyberstorm as far as I can
tell is social engineering. Well this time, we are going to have social
engineering combined with physical access control. All documented on
camera, mostly CCTV.  That's going to be awesome.

I totally want to continue with the bug bounty topic. Swiss companies
are very slow to adopt bug bounty programs and I think this is a
mistake.  I'm in contact with a top shot in this area, but she has not
confirmed yet.

The dark net is vastly attractive as a topic for a conference. It's sex
and crime combined with security. It's kind of a safe bet that any tech
audience will love that. We've done a dark net talk in 2015 and one in
2016. This time we are changing the perspective a bit and return to the
topic of bullet proof hosting. The traditional bullet proof hosting (RBN
and the like) is dead. But there is a new type of malign hosting
that is much harder to identify and even harder to fight. We have an
expert on that topic coming from the States and I am very glad he
confirmed.

And finally I just got the green light from a major player in a highly
contested area of security in Switzerland. This green light will allow
us to create a focus point around that area. I'll leave you guessing
what this might be for a few weeks, while I talk to the right people
to set this up.

So that's it for the moment. We are going to start to announce the first
speakers soon. But if you liked the outlook above, you do not have to
wait any longer to secure your ticket for the conference.  The early
bird [FIXME: Link http://www.eventbee.com/v/scs2017] has started.
