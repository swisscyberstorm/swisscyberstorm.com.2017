---

At Swiss Cyber Storm 2016, Walter Belgers from TOOOL Netherlands
presented lock-picking as a metaphor of IT security hacking. This years
speaker Deviant Ollam is Walter's counterpart in TOOOL United States. He
has been called the godfather of Locksport and will show us how he combines lock
picking and the hacking of IT security systems to conquer physical
access control.  Add social engineering to give it an additional twist
and you get a very strong talk.

Deviant Ollam is best known for his role at DefCon and Shmoocon, namely
in the Lockpick Village. But he is also a pioneering Android expert that
pushed the limits of security on the systems when security was literally
non-existing on these devices (not that much improved on Android in this
regard). Few will know, however, that he is also the uncrowned king of
hotel room cuisine and the Chef among the frequent flyers.

If that is
still not enough to convince you that Devian Ollam is a gorgeous
addition to our schedule, then ask him about his experience with flying
with firearms or his recent flamethrower weekend. This man has war stories to last a week!
