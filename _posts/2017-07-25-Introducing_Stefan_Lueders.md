title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Stefan L&uuml;ders

There is no business case for securing IoT hardware. There is no
legislation and no incentive to lock it down. But there is a lot of
legal knowledge how a manufacturer can sneak out of the
responsibility via extensive EULAs. Our industry has been having great
fun dissecting electronic scales, smart toothbrushes and even IoT egg
containers (here at SCS!). This was all a bit theoretical since nobody
sane in his mind would buy an electronic egg container and even if,
electronic egg containers are hardly mission critical.

But it was only a question of time before these gadgets would morph
into something useful and until they would hit our corporate networks.
This is about to happen right now and so it's time to look at this in
more detail.

When thinking about IoT for our conference, we wanted to have a speaker
who has daily exposure to these problems. We were looking for somebody
exploring the frontiers of securing IoT devices and we are very happy
we have found a skilled presenter at CERN in Switzerland who is facing
these questions every day: Dr. Stefan L&uuml;ders.

<i>Stefan L&uuml;ders, CISO at CERN</i>

Stefan L&uuml;ders is a physicist turned CISO who took over the job to
secure the complete infrastructure and operation at CERN from the
desktops, the WiFi access points, the interconnection links with other
research organisations, to the dozen different accelerators & experiments with the LHC
being only one of them. All these accelerators are supported by dozens
of different infrastructure systems, all operated and monitored with
the help of industrial control systems. But these ICS started to grow
into fully operated computers: Internet of Things devices. And while
there are some established procedures on how to secure ICS (segregation
into small compartments is probably best known), these approaches no
longer work. The devices are much more powerful and people want them to
be interconnected. So we need new approaches to operate them in a
secure manner.

<i>STefan L&uuml;ders at Vox Days 2017</i>

Stefan L&uuml;ders is a renown speaker and long time CISO at CERN. Mirroring
the multinational setup of CERN, he is a German living in France and
working in Switzerland. Stefan is a very good Squash player leading the
CERN leaderboard but he is also a big collector of LEGO (and this
makes me much more jealous than his Squash skills). He has a complete,
all time LEGO Fire Brigade collection and an extensive set of railways
including the famous 1980ties models. I remember my cousin and me
setting up the rails in a ring and having them collide at full speed...

[Join us and register](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/conference/)
for the Swiss Cyberstorm Conference on 18th October to hear how
CERN manages to keep their network secure despite a myriad of ICS and IoT
devices invading its network.
