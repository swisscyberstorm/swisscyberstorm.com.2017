title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Cément Guitton

There have been a few statements by Swiss politicians lately, trying to
funnel more money into the army to grow real cyber units with extensive
attack capabilities. Initiatives as this have been around for a while
and usually I do not bother, but the statements are growing more
systematic in recent weeks. On top of it, they coincidence with the
ongoing definition of the 2nd edition of the National Cyber Strategy
("Nationale Strategie zum Schutz der Schweiz vor Cyber-Risiken") and
this makes the discussion a bit unsettling.

There is a case though. The NCS aims to define a policy for the
non-military domain and the non-crisis situations. So what is the role
of the military in all of this and what do you do when there is a
national crisis? I see room for discussion and the military seems overly
limited in its cyber defense resources and capabilities. But I doubt the
idea of so called "offensive defense" in cyberspace and I certainly don't
buy into
the plan to train militia soldiers in four months to become national
"cyber warriors". There are many cases that can be brought up against this
idea, and I am quite sure that attribution is often one of them.

Difficulties around investigating cyber attacks and, eventually,
identifying the instigators mean that the process is far from being
straight forward. Naturally, that means that we need to take into
consideration these different difficulties around attribution when looking
at retaliation. Combining a lack of reliable information with extensive
attack capabilities in the hands of under-trained amateurs would certainly
create a dangerous mix. It would be like putting soldiers with a rifle into
the fog and asking them to return the fire hoping to hit the attacker.

Attribution is notoriously tough. Maybe that's why you've read little
constructive
essays about the topic. Enters Dr. Clément Guitton. Clément Guitton
received his PhD from the Department of War Studies at King's College,
London, and worked as an analyst with the Department of Defense in
Switzerland.  In June, he joined SwissRe as a political risk analyst. A
few weeks before, he published "Inside the Enemy's Computer. Identifying
Cyber Attackers", a book focusing on attribution that
received much acclaim.

The acclaim is entirely justified since Clément Guitton really
sat down, put things into perspective and added the necessary and
unavoidable political dimension to
attribution. He provides a dependable framework to navigate
attribution cases and come to reliable conclusions.

This means that Clément Guitton's much needed input has brought light into a
dark area of our profession. How such conclusions translate for
Switzerland, a small country with little leverage, especially when compared
with the usual countries at the center of attention (think of the US,
Russia, China, Iran), makes up for an exciting discussion. 
For instance, Switzerland has made veiled allegations that it thinks Russia
stood behind several attacks on our country. But realistically, what can
the country do next? How can Switzerland deter or even retaliate? What
would a strategy look like? Such a strategy would probably have to
encompass non-cyber attack related measures, ranging from the diplomatic
(and ineffective) slap on the wrist to financial sanctions that
have a high potential to spiral out of control rapidly. Outside of
being not in our own interest.

Let's hear what Dr. Clément Guitton has to tell us. We still have a few
early bird tickets left - that's the ones with 15% discount on the full
price. Register here to reserve one of these tickets and join us at the
Swiss Cyber Storm Conference on October 18, 2017, in Lucerne.
