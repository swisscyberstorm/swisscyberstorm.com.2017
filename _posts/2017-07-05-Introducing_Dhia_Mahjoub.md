When we think of Bulletproof Hosting, we usually think of shady firms
in the style of the Russian Business Network that dodge all inquiries and
take-down notices from governments and potentially operating in corrupt
legislations where such behaviour is accepted. Nowadays, this
traditional centralized Bulletproof Hosting no longer works, although it
did not disappear. 
It has in fact morphed into a more modern flexible and elusive style
where hosters diversify their footprints across various spaces and
jurisdictions 
and act as dynamic business partners for criminals that want to host
illegal contents online. Copyright infringement? Not all country
prosecute it. Illegal Porn? Better know the jurisdiction. Stolen
data? We have servers in locations were your government won't be able
to reach them.

As Head of Security Research at Cisco Umbrella (formerly OpenDNS), 
Dr. Dhia Mahjoub has excellent insight into the various moves of 
these shady web citizens. The key is of course making good use of the 
data and it takes a data scientist like Dhia to discover usage 
patterns in Autonomous Systems (AS) that allow to predict which 
IP addresses or domain names will be used for cybercrime before 
it actually happens.

Dhia Mahjoub leads the core research team focused on large scale threat
detection, threat intelligence and advises on Research and Development
strategy. Dhia has a background in networks and security, holds a 
PhD in graph algorithms applied on Wireless Sensor Networks problems.

When I met Dhia at Usenix Enima in January 2017, I immediately realized
that is a very skilled speaker. Looking up his bio underlined that impression
and revealed dozens of presentations at the biggest security conferences
all over the world: Black Hat, DefCon, RSA, ShmooCon, InfoSec Europe,
etc. etc. But then he continued and explained to me how he thinks that 
there is a bullet proof hoster operating from Switzerland and I was sold:
Here is a perfect Swiss Cyber Storm speaker!
