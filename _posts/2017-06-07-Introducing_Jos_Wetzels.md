title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speaker Jos Wetzels

The internet of things is all the rage and talks about the insecurity of smart
devices and tech assistants are a constant companion at tech conferences these days. But
it's also a bit boring in the sense that the whole audience knows IoT is
insecure and the presentations are often déjà-vus of stupid mistakes on
cheap devices.

Things get different when you stop talking about toothbrushes and
toasters and you turn to devices and control systems where security really
matters in a direct way. Health is often quoted (think pacemakers
with a remote control) and of course SCADA systems in high security
environments.

Our Swiss Cyber Storm Speaker Jos Wetzels has seen a lot of these devices. 
His research with Twente University has focused on the protection of
critical infrastructures such as electric, oil, gas and water utilities.
Furthermore, it involved analysis of the operating systems used in cars, nuclear
power plants and military fighter jets.

A lot of this work has been carried out
under the seal of NDAs (sorry, no photo of Jos in a MIG cockpit). But some of the
vulnerabilities can be disclosed and nothing prevents him from talking about structural
problems he regularly encounters when working with industrial control systems
and IoT devices. One such structural problem is the search for a decent source
of entropy. Getting truly random numbers is hard and obtaining them in a controlled
setting is a contradiction in itself. His recent CCC presentation exemplified this
in great detail.

But Jos won't stop at pointing out shortcomings in existing systems. His
Swiss Cyber Storm presentation will also give advice on good IoT security. What you
can do to improve the situation in constrained environments and where developers
can make a difference.

Jos has been part of the European Union's PREEMPTIVE project for the
protection of critical infrastructure. He has taught hands-on offensive
security classes at the Dutch Kerckhoffs Institute and he occasionally shows up
at Capture the Flag events. On top of that, I can confirm that Jos is good
company at a conference and I hope you get the chance to talk to him.

The early bird tickets for Swiss Cyber Storm are being sold until June 30, 2017.
