title: Introducing Swiss Cyber Storm 2017 Speakers Antonio Barresi and Matthias Ganz

It is hard to teach people not to click on links and attachments or to avoid
suspicious places on the web.  Would not it be smarter if systems in general
would not be vulnerable to PDF exploits and drive by downloads?  Yet it seems
surprisingly difficult to achieve this and I have often wondered why that is
the case.

Xorlab is a Swiss startup that attempts to attack that bull by the horns. It's
founders go all in on the malicious payload and examine its behaviour while
being parsed. This ETH spin-off started two years ago and is now piloting it's
new applicance. But this is not at the center of our attention.

Instead, CEO Antonio Barresi and CTO Matthias Ganz will put their venture in a
wider perspective and give us a general overview over modern means of
mitigations when attackers aim for memory corruption vulnerabilities.

What types of techniques exist in modern systems? How are they deployed and
enabled? What might we see in the future?

We all know about Data Execution Prevention and Address Space Layout
Randomization (and if you do not, then you still have 12 days until the
conference to look it up). But what exists to make the moat wider and the walls
thicker for the attackers?

It is a highly technical topic that lies at the core of many of today's
security problems. That is why we are very happy to have two experts on the
topic at Swiss Cyber Storm. Antonio and Matthias have that deep interest on
security problems that are very close to the hardware (something they share
with our speaker Jos Wetzels) and namely Antonio has travelled far and wide to
also speak about it.

I am looking forward to present these fine speakers to you and I hope to see
you in Lucerne as well.  If you have not registered, it is time [to do so](https://www.eventbee.com/v/scs2017).
