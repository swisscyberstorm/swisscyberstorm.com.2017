<h2>Become a Benefactor</h2>

<p> Organizing a conference like Swiss Cyber Storm and running the Swiss qualifier for the European Cyber Security Challenge is not possible without a highly motivated team, the support of our generous sponsors and you as an attendee – thank you very much!</p>

<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12">
<p>The same can be said for Swiss Cyber Storm’s effort to be prepared for the future - We need to continuously improve the conference and our activities to find and promote young cyber talents.</p>

<p>If you like what we are doing and if you want to support our non-profit organization and our volunteering more actively, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become a benefactor</li>
<li>Become a member of the organizing committee</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefactor</h3>
<p>Support us without lifting a finger ;-) For the amount of CHF 1000 you will get one entrance ticket for the upcoming conference without any further liabilities. Furthermore, you are invited to attend the general assembly with a subsequent dinner.</p>

<h3>Swiss Cyber Storm Organizing Committee Member</h3>
<p>Give us some of your spare-time and help us organize and further evolve the Swiss Cyber Storm events and activities.</p>
